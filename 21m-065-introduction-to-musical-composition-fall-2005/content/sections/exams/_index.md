There will be five quizzes; each will be in two parts. The first portion will test your recognition of the assigned listening (I'll ask you to name the title, composer, and performer, as applicable). The second portion will test your knowledge of the terms and concepts from the assigned reading. Each quiz will last about 15-20 minutes.

The first three quizzes are presented below.
